# Pygame-Purple-Jungle

A platformer game I made to practice game physics, parallax backgrounds and character animmations. 

The background consists of four layers moving in correlation with the character at 1x, 0.75x, 0.5x, and 0.25x speeds.

The character has 5 animated actions. The character can be idle, running left, running right, jumping left or jumping right. Each animated cycle has 8 images that last 5 frames each at 120 frames per second or 0.33s per cycle.

The repository also includes a Windows executable made with cx_Freeze.
